#Hibernate Example

Well, I created this project to test a few things of Hibernate.

To be honest, it was a lot hard to find out many of these things, at least for me!

A few things you can see in here!

 - How to use SQLite on Hibernate.
 - How to create an Hibernate connection *without those damn XML files*
 - How to make Hibernate create the tables for your database, *without those damn XML files*

JPA:

How to create Entities with embeddable keys.
How to create Entities with Collections inside it (ShopCart with several Items);

And maybe a few other things.
